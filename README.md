# WidgetsPractice
short description: this flutter project is done to show that the topic of "Widgets" is understood and practiced well. In the greeting.dart file we can see simple text; in the counter.dart file we can see the button for incrementing and its result. 
full description for each step:
This is a Flutter project called WidgetsPractice. It demonstrates how to create and use both Stateless and Stateful Widgets, 
and how to create a widget tree at least 3 levels deep. It also demonstrates how to style widgets and test the app.
To Run the Project

1. I installed Flutter and Dart.
2.Created a new file named greeting.dart inside the lib folder. This widget will display a greeting message passed as a parameter.
3.In main.dart file, I used the GreetingWidget with different messages
4.Then I created a new file named counter.dart. This widget will display a counter that increments when a button is pressed.
5.In main.dart, I added the CounterWidget below the GreetingWidget
6.I customized the styles of the widgets by adjusting font sizes, colors, padding directly in their widget classes.
7.Finally it should be run the app using flutter run in the terminal or just pressing run button top of the editor. To make sure everything works as expected on an emulator or a real device I
checked whole code in flutlab.io
